## ABSTRACT

**Abstract:** Adapt to the increasing amount of astronomical data, the manual methods of classification are not sufficient enough, so the use of machine learning has been developing rapidly. Galaxy merger is an important process that affects the formation and evolution of galaxies. How to classify the galaxy mergers accurately and automatically under massive data has become an urgent need. As a public science project, the Galaxy Zoo has the largest and most accurate data set currently. Based on the decision tree of the Galaxy Zoo, we divide merging galaxies into two categories: ”merger” and ”post­merger”. We used the residual network ResNet­18. On the galaxy zoo dataset based on the dark energy legacy survey, we selected 3128 merged galaxies for binary classification training, and finally obtained 98.12% accuracy rate.
